The project developed in this work aimed to create a mobile application dedicated to skiers, designed to provide intuitive and accessible information about ski resorts, slopes, weather conditions, and available facilities.

By utilizing technologies such as React Native, Expo, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL, a robust, modular, and scalable system was implemented, offering:

- An intuitive and user-friendly interface for the target audience;

- Quick access to detailed information about resorts and ski slopes;

- Integration of real-time weather data through the OpenWeather API;

- GPS-based location and map navigation for easy orientation;

- Secure user authentication and the ability to personalize the experience through individual accounts.

During the development process, multiple interconnected modules were implemented, allowing the creation of a complete application with functionalities relevant to a broad audience of winter sports enthusiasts.

Moreover, the proposed architecture allows for easy future expansion of features, both by adding new resorts and slopes and by integrating advanced modules such as personalized recommendation systems, technical performance analysis on slopes, safety alerts, and advanced data management.

This application thus offers a modern solution tailored to the real needs of skiers, emphasizing information, safety, personalization, and an enhanced user experience.
